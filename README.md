# HTML-Projects
This folder includes all the code I have been using to create my own personal website through HTML and CSS.
Most of these will come from freeCodeCamp, but regardless there are some projects that are my own. I am trying to learn HTML and CSS in the next month to strengthen my FrontEnd capabilities.
